# Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries

## Introduction

Developed for the Design of Algorithms course (Spring 2024) at the University of Porto, this project focuses on analyzing and solving the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) in the context of ocean shipping and urban deliveries. It utilizes various heuristic approaches to efficiently handle complex routing problems that are otherwise intractable due to their size and constraints.

## Features

- Implementation of a basic exhaustive TSP approach for small graphs.
- Development of heuristic algorithms, including a triangular approximation approach for larger datasets.
- Data parsing and processing from provided CSV files.
- User-friendly menu interface for selecting and running different algorithmic approaches.
- Visual and analytical presentation of algorithmic performance and efficiency.

## Algorithmic Approach

The project uses a combination of backtracking for small graphs and heuristic methods for larger problems. A particular focus is on the triangular approximation heuristic, which provides a guaranteed approximation bound for certain classes of graphs.

## Documentation 

The project's documentation is generated using Doxygen and is available under the docs directory. It includes detailed descriptions of all implemented functions and algorithms, along with their time complexity analysis.
